# Code_Refactor-1
First homework/challenge called "Code Refactor":

The assignment is supposed to mimic a real-world situation where a client has requested for their website to be updated using 
the newest technologies and features of HTML5/CSS3 for ease-of-view and accesibility of the user. 

The code was reviewed, edited, marked-up, and streamlined to function the same as it did before. 

Using the "Scout's Honor" principle, the application was also furnished with a few novel upgrades.
