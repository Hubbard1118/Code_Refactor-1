# Code_Refactor-1
First homework/challenge called Code Refactor

The assignment is supposed to mimic a real-world situation where a client has requested for their website to be updated using 
the newest technologies and features for ease-of-view and accesibility for the user. 

The code was reviewed, edited, and streamlined to function the same as it did before. 

Using the "Scout's Honor" principle, the application was also furnised with a few novel upgrades.
